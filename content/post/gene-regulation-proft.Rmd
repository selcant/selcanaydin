## Dissecting mechanisms of gene expression regulation using single-cell measurements

Make this into a summary of that project + what we are interested in and what are our main findings. 


Rienzo A., Poveda-Huertes D., Aydin S., Buchler N.E., Pascual-Ahuir A., Proft M. (2015). Different mechanisms confer gradual control and memory at nutrient- and stress-regulated genes in yeast. Mol Cell Biol, 35:3669â€“3683.
