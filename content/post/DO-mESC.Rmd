My current and future research plans focus on defining the role of genetic variation in cell fate decisions with an emphasis on embryonic stem cells and mouse development.

K., Martin, W., Qin, W., Harrill, A. H., Choi, T., Churchill, G. A., Munger, S. C., Baker, C. L., Reinholdt, L. G. Genetic variation influences pluripotent ground state stability in mouse embryonic stem cells through a hierarchy of molecular phenotypes. (2019) bioRxiv, 552059.

## Influence of genetic variation on cell state transitions

We have contrasted global gene expression and QTL mapping results between embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from many Diversity Outbred (DO) mice.
